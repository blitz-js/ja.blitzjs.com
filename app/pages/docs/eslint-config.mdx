Blitz extends the
[create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/setting-up-your-editor/#experimental-extending-the-eslint-config)
eslint config.

Our configuration contains a few modifications, and the full preset can be
found on github
[here](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/blob/canary/packages/eslint-config/index.js),

This configuration is found in .eslintrc.js, and by default is

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ["blitz"],
}
```

## Extending or replacing the default Blitz ESLint config {#extending}

You can extend the base Blitz ESLint config, or replace it completely if you need.

There are a few things to remember:

1. We highly recommend extending the base config, as removing it could introduce hard-to-find issues.
2. It's important to note that any rules that are set to "error" will stop the project from building.

In the below example:

  - the base config has been extended by a shared ESLint config,
  - a new rule has been set that applies to all JavaScript and TypeScript files

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ["blitz", "shared-config"],
  rules: {
    "additional-rule": "warn"
  },
}
```
